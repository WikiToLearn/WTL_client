#  What is WikiToLearn
*WikiToLearn is a portal that aims to create free collaborative and readily accessible textbooks. Our philosophy can be summarised as "Knowledge only grows if shared". On this platform, teaching and studying merges into the cooperative writing and revision of notes and textbooks, which can then be organized and reassembled, according to each user's needs.*

Your contribution, as small as it may be, is and will always be fundamental. Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. If you share our vision, our desire, feel free to help. Your effort will not be vain, that's for sure.


Iâ€™m a university student, I don't have time for this...

Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarizing are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams as well as improve your explanation skills. Moreover, in the case where you make a mistake, someone will correct you. WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the professors, who, among other things, will be able to assess the effectiveness of their own lessons.
